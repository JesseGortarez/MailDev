# MailDev: HTML Email Development Support

## Why?

Email development suffers from a serious lack of standards and continues to fall behind web development practices which are standardized. Despite the headaches developing for email can cause, it's still one of the best ways to communicate with your users and customers. Since we have to do it, we might as well look for ways to make it easier. MailDev is here as a simple tool comprised of several other simple tools to help us developers get our email projects completed correctly and much more quickly.

## Setup

- Install Node
- Run `npm install` to get the necessary packages.
- Run `grunt` to build and watch (with live reload) template files.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues with `npm install`, you may need to install Command Line Utilities (on Mac).

The utilities can be installed (on Mac) with `xcode-select --install`.
